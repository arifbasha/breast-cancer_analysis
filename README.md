# Breast Cancer Data Analysis
Breast cancer is a cancer that develops from breast tissue. It occurs as a results of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. Not all tumors are harmful, it is classified as benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) tumors. I carried out this data analysis on the given dataset , which includes measurements of breast cancer cells. Features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Task that i caried out in the analysis are;
1. Loaded the given dataset
2. Loaded the header file
3. Calculated the mean and median for smoothness and compactness fields for benign and malignant tumors
4. Identified the important features using Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Build 2 classification techniques using the important features
  5.1 Logistic Regression classification
  5.2 Random Forest Classification
6. Calculated the accuracy of the model
